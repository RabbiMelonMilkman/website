        I've been spending time refining my digital organization and building healthier habits. More to come.

        I'm trying this logging thing again. <br>
        Today I did the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Worked on my bike - derusting with vinegar + sandpaper
            </li>
            <li>
                Touched up resume and Linkedin
            </li>
            <li>
                Did the Neovim built in Tutorial.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ran llama 3.1 8b locally.
            </li>
            <li>
                Got through all my photos from 2020.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set up DNS for new domain
            </li>
        </ul>

        <em>Thoughts on bike</em><br>
        The vinegar plus sand paper worked really well. I may do another round or two. I'll go later this weak to buy a rear rack.<br>
        <em>Thoughs on resume</em><br>
        I was planning on applying to jobs at university, but they all required a cover letter and pay way less then my current gig. ew.<br>
        <em>Thoughts on Neovim</em><br>
        Don't really see the appeal lol. My plan is to do the primeagen series tutorial, check out what yacine has with configs and stuff. Finally I'll built 1 or 2 small projects only with Neovim. <br>
        What I really want to do is learn emacs. <br>
        <em>Thoughts on LLM</em><br>
        What I did was download ollama and open-webui. It's super slow. There seems to be lots of layers of complexity to this - there is a large gap between the theoretical aspects and practicaly using this stuff. Tomorrow the gang and I will try and see how to host this stuff on the cloud for cheap.<br>
        <em>Thoughts on Photos</em><br>
        I need to make a whole webpage about this. Essentially I've been trying to organize my digital data and be less reliant on the big dogs. Almost done. <br>
        <em>Thoughts on GoDaddy</em><br>
        The domain was cheap, but the UI is very clunky, and condiguring DNS just didnt work for a few days. I need to just learn to host stuff myself. Squarespace is no better.
