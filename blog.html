        <p>Yesterday was a “disaster” in terms of my long term plan. Yet it was
        an opportunity to reflect on what I’ve learnt so far in this new
        journey:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>19 thousand twitter posts and 370 followers:
        <ul>
        <li>Execute like I tweet. Post this as a blog. Who cares.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Consistency and Routine lead to compounding growth:
        <ul>
        <li>Doing something everyday for 30 minutes is easy and has huge long
        term benefits.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Drugs, woman, and all other desires have a time and place:
        <ul>
        <li>Unless you can sacrifice tomorrows plan, don’t do it.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In that spirit, I have been journaling for a while daily. Maybe I
        should just post it as a blog instead of keep it to myself.</p>
